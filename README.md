# Totally.Social
#### This platform is meant to be used to share ideas and build connections.

The frontend is built with React, Bootstrap and a bit of CSS.  The backend server is a Django Rest Framework API.

The main content item is a post.  Each post can be up to 240 characters and may include images.  Posts may have comments, likes, and can be reposted.  The project includes users with authentication and profiles.  The main view is a feed of followed users posts.  Each user has a profile picture, status, follower count, and other information.  User can also be messaged directly, and recent conversations are displayed in the message inbox view.
